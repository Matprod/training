You will find in this directory some classes:
- bag: an abstract class representing a bag.
- searchable_bag: an abstract class representing a bag with the ability to search in it.
- array_bag: an implementation of a bag using an array as the underlying data structure.
- tree_bag: an implementation of a bag using a binary search tree as the underlying data structure.

First part:
Since a bag without a searching function isn't very useful, implement two classes:
- searchable_array_bag (inherits from array_bag and implements searchable_bag)
- searchable_tree_bag (inherits from tree_bag and implements searchable_bag)

Second part:
Implement the class set that will wrap a searchable_bag and turn it into a set.

All your classes must:
- Follow the orthodox canonical form (constructor, copy, assignment, destructor).
- Correctly use const where appropriate.

You will find a main in this directory that must compile and run with your code.
